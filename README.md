## Version of libmseed

Currently this library requires `libmseed` version 3.1.1 (or newer patch
versions). The source for `libmseed` is included in the `libmseed-sys` crate so
there's no need to pre-install the `libmseed` library, the `libmseed-sys` crate
will figure that and/or build that for you.
